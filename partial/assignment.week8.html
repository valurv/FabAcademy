<div class="page-header"><h1>Week 8 <small>computer-controlled machining</small></h1></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12">		<p>I was very excited about this week assignment so I ended up making two furnitures, one shelf and one coffee table. I started with the shelf. First I drew a 1/2 dome (or		1/4 bubble)	in SketchUp and used the plug in Slice modeller to make it as press fit. I imported that drawing into Vcarve. Then I added T-bones so that it would fit nicely together.	I made it out of 12 mm mdf, because some day I will paint it. I used a router table to make 5 mm radius on every outside edge just to make it look better. The painting will waitfor another day, but I'm pretty happy with the shelf as it is.	</p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-6">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w7_hilla1.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-6">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w7_hilla2.jpg"></img></div><div class="col-md-12">		<p> I got a new sofa in my living room so the old coffee table didn't fit. So I did some measuring and thought about what I wanted in a table. I needed drawers to hide theremote and stuff and I also wanted a big drawer for the keyboard and mouse, but there is a computer connected to the TV screen. With that in mind, I designed the table and drewit in SketchUp. Again I used 12 mm mdf, because I knew I would definitely paint the table and I wanted to have the finishing surface smooth.	</p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-12">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w7_sketchupbord.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-12">		<p> I was happy that the whole table fitted easily to one board of 12 mm mdf but I used two 30 mm mdf glued together to make the table legs. I wanted the table legs tohave some decoration/old look so I used turning lathe to get that look.		</p>	</div>		<div class="col-md-4">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w7_progress.jpg"></img></div>		<div class="col-md-4">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w7_progress2.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-4">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w7_progress3.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-12">		<p> I started by making toolpath with 1/4 down cut two flute endmill 3 mm down around every piece, to make the top surface cuts better so the milling bits would not tear upmdf. Then I switched to up cut two flute endmill and finished all the cutting with it, except I made tabs to hold every piece down but I made little bigger tabs to hold thedrawers in place. The reason for that to make it easier for assembly. Before I put the table together I made some decoration with router to get that old fashion look I wanted on thetable. Then I put the table together with stable gun and wood glue, and when the glued was dried I sawed the drawer tabs away so I could take them out before the paint job.   	</p>	</div>		<div class="col-md-12">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w7_progress4.jpg"></img></div>		<div class="col-md-12">		<p>To get that old fashion look I painted the table with chalk paint so I could get some "weathering" on the edges, and I used a pallet wood for the table top to perfectthe old rough look. Needless to say I'm very happy with the table, and so are the rest of my family.	</p>	</div>		<div class="col-md-6">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w7_table.jpg"></img></div>			<div class="col-md-6">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w7_table2.jpg"></img></div><div class="col-md-12">		<p>Still I needed some handles on the drawers so I drew them also in SketchUp and 3D milled it in the Shopbot.
