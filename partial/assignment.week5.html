<div class="page-header"><h1>Week 5 <small>3D scanning and printing</small></h1></div><h3></h3><div class="row">	<div class="col-md-12">		<p>I have an old 3D printer, or the first generation of cube 3D printer, and I decided to start to print out „test print“  that you can find on thingiverse.com, 		just to test the ability of the printer. Shortly after it started to print I noticed that it was about time to clean the print nozzle. Based on the „test print“ the 3D printer is not accurate enough for the mission. </p> </div>	<div class="col-md-5">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w5_3dprinttest.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-5">				<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w5_3dprinttest2.jpg"></img></div></div><div class="row">	<div class="col-md-8">		<p> I decided to scan in a little bird key chain by taking photos of it and insert it in the 123dcatch application. That did not go well because there was no shadow on the bird and the pictures lacked some background. </p> </div>	<div class="col-md-8">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w5_fuglpc.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-8">		<p> That's why I decided to scan it with Roland MDX-20 and that went very well. I only scanned one half, milled it out with the ShopBot out of MDF, turned it around and milled the other side and it came out pretty good, much better than I expected. </p> </div>		<div class="col-md-8">				<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w5_fugl.jpg"></img></div></div>
