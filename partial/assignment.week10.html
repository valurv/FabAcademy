<div class="page-header"><h1>Week 10 <small>molding and casting</small></h1></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12">		<p>This week assignment is to design a 3D mold, machine it and cast parts from it. 		I have been working on a Daft Punk helmet for fun that I will someday mold so I decided to make a ear piece for the helmet for this week assignment.  </p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-5">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_daftpunk1.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-5">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_daftpunk2.jpg"></img></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12">		<p>The ear piece has to be in two parts because in between there is supposed to be led light. I drawed the piece in Skecthup and saved it as an stl file. Then I opened the file in Partworks3D and made paths there.  </p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-5">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_computer.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-5">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_partworks.jpg"></img></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12">		<p>I decided to use 1/8 ball nose milling bit and I used the same milling bits both for refining and finishing. Because then  I didn´t have to chance bit in the middle of the project and the z zero would be the same.  I milled it in a machine able wax in the Shopbot. </p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-12">		<p> Do not try to clean the milling bit with your fingers, it's sharp! </p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-5">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_fingers.jpg"></img></div></div><div class="col-md-12">		<p>I screwed down wooden pieces in to the sacrificial layer all around the wax.  I couldn’t move the wax piece so I didn’t need to put any pressure on the top of the wax. 		I wanted to collect the leftovers of the wax so I didn't turn the vaccume on, because you can melt back to some block and use it again.			Then the machine worked it‘s magic.</p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-4">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_wax.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-4">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_shopbot.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-4">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_finish.jpg"></img></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12">		<p>I wanted to try the OOMOO 25 on a test subject before I used it on my mold because I suspected that it was too old to use, and sad to say, I was right. </p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-6">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_badone.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-6">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_badone2.jpg"></img></div><div class="col-md-12">		<p>Because the wait would be far to long for new OOMOO 25 I used Silicon Rubber instead. I measured the volume of the silicon rubber by pouring water into the mold 		and devided the water into two cups. I marked each cup by drawing a line on it and used the cups as measurement to know how much compound A and B I should use. 		Then I blended the compound together in a bigger cup and mixed it by stirring it together with back and forward movement, because circular movement adds more air bubbles		in the silicon rubber.</p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-6">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_water.jpg"></img></div>				<div class="col-md-6">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_siliconmold.jpg"></img></div>	<div class="col-md-12">		<p>I poured the compound into the machinable wax mold and let it dry over night. When the negative mold was ready I mixed Hydro stone compound with pure Icelandic		water and poured that into the mold. I tapped the mold a little bit to make the air bubbles come up and waited for it to dry. When Hydro stone compound had dried I took itout of the silicon mold and my two pieces for the ear piece was ready. When I will finish the ear piece		in the future I will make a acrylic circle that will fit between the two pieces and there will be led in the ear piece that will glow through the acrylic.</p>	</div>		<div class="col-md-6">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_final2.jpg"></img></div>				<div class="col-md-6">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w8_final.jpg"></img></div>	</div>
