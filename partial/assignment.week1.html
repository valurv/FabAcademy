<div class="page-header"><h1>Week 1 <small>project management</small></h1></div><h3></h3><div class="row">	<div class="col-md-12">		<p>When I was thinking about what I would like to be my final project the first thing that came to mind was a basketball basket that would catch the ball, even that I would miss (thatrarely happens =) and pass it back to me wherever I would be at. I would have some kind of sensor strapped on me and the basket will pass the ball to me at any direction and range.And also I would be able to program some shooting exercise. But then I looked outside and remembered that I live in the harsh environment in Iceland and wouldn't be able to useit as much as I like and would have to store it inside. So I started to think about some inside project, and decided that I would like to make home automation.So I decided that I would start with one room in my basement that I'm going to call Moodroom/Gameroom/Cinemaroom.</p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-12">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w1_room1.jpg"></img>				</div>I am going to divide the project for the room into a few project. The projects are to control the floor heated temperature, the ceiling light and the light that will come in the room,or controlling the curtains and finally to open and close the windows.  I'm not going to do it all right now but the final project will be about the curtains.I will have a phototransistor to measure the light from the windows and some motor to open and close the curtains.</p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-12">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w1_window.jpg"></img>				</div>	<div class="col-md-12">The main goal with that room is to see how much I can do by myself to create a room with some Wow factor and I want to have the first reaction of the people who walk in to be"Wow, why/how do you do it?!".</p>	</div></div>
