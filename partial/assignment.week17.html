<div class="page-header"><h1>Week 17 <small>applications and implications</small></h1></div><h3>The final project is like I have said before a automated/brightness controlled motor for curtains for my Cinemaroom.      What will it do?	  I will have a photo transistor measuring the light level that comes through a window in the room and decides if the curtains are going to be open or closed. There are twowindows in the room and I will make some networking between the windows to control curtains in both of them.	  	        Who's done what beforehand?	  There are a lot of people who have done a similar thing. But I make my project from scratch to learn as much as I can.	        What materials and components will be required?	  I will need a curtains for the windows, motor to pull the curtains up and down, photo transistor and  micro controller board with some resistors, capacitors and some	  3D printed parts.	        Where will they come from?	  The curtains I bought in hardware store, rest of the items will be from FAB inventory.	        How much will it cost?	  The curtains I bought were on sale for 1000 ISK kr. The rest is from FAB inventory.	        What parts and systems will be made?	  I will make the input board (board with photo transistor),  an output board (board with the motor) and some mechanical/3D printed parts that connect from the motor to 	  the curtains.	        What processes will be used?	  Most of the time will be in programming in Arduino environment (C-code), because I'm a beginner at programming. That will be the hardest part and a big challenge.	        What tasks need to be completed?	  So that the curtains will work I will need to complete the programming. 	        what questions need to be answered?      what is the schedule?      how will it be evaluated?	  	  </h3>   projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery of all of the skills   where possible, you should make rather than buy the parts of your project
