<div class="page-header"><h1>Week 4 <small>electronics production</small></h1></div><h3></h3><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12">		<p>This week I make a FabISP board. The FabISP is an in-system programmer for AVR micro controllers, designed for production within FabLab. 		I will mill the board and then set some components on it. When I milled the board I had to use two sizes of milling bits. 		I used 1/64 milling bit when I was milling the trace and then I used 1/32 milling bit when cutting out the board. </p>	</div>	<div class="col-md-6">		<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w4_1.jpg"></img><div class="col-md-12">		<p>Then it comes to the components. I started to set the usb connector on the board followed by the micro controller. 		Bit by bit I put the rest of the components on and ended with the 6 pin connector. </p>	</div>		<div class="col-md-6">	<img class="img-responsive img-thumbnail center-block" src="/content/w4_2.jpg"></img></div></div>
